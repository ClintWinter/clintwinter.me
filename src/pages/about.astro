        <p class="drop-cap">I am a seasoned senior full-stack web developer based in New Jersey. My primary focus is on crafting pragmatic solutions that not only get the job done but do so efficiently and elegantly. I firmly believe that perfection, while admirable, should never stand in the way of delivering exceptional results.</p>
        <p>My journey in web development began in October 2015 at CWR Electronics. From there I evolved through roles at DirectLync, and finally landed at Givebutter in January 2021, where I currently serve as a senior full-stack developer. Laravel and PHP are my forte, and I'm well-versed in React, TypeScript, Svelte, and Tailwind CSS as well.</p>
        <p>My approach to development is user-centric. I believe in asking the right questions and understanding the unique needs of each project to create solutions that truly resonate with users. Clean code and effective problem-solving are at the core of my work.</p>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the web, where I'll be sharing insights, tips, and projects from my journey in web development.</p>
