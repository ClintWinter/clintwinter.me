Hello Laravel hiring team! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Clint Winter**, a senior full-stack developer at [Givebutter](https://givebutter.com). I'm excited to be applying to your <u>_Senior Full-stack Developer position_</u>. I have been a huge Laravel fan for a while now, so having the opportunity to join the core team means a lot to me.

#### About Me

* I'm totally **self-taught** and have been involved in PHP and, subsequently, Laravel going on 9 years now.
* I currently work with a Laravel back-end and a React/TypeScript SPA front-end in my daily work.
* I've been remote most of my careerâ€”there would be no adjustment for me to continue doing so.
* I'm located in New Jersey, USA, so I'm in the EST/EDT timezone.

#### Public Work

I don't have a ton of work out there publicly, unfortunately, but [I'm working on changing that](https://x.com/clintwinter13/status/1774116029188165679).

I did a lot of work on [a package that adds custom fields to Laravel](https://github.com/givebutter/laravel-custom-fields/pull/36) that I'm proud of. It's a package maintained by my company, originally developed by our CTO Liran and Daniel Coulborne. I linked to a specific PR that is a good representation of my attention to detailâ€”both in the PR description and comments, as well as the code.

You can see my [blog posts](https://clintwinter.me/blog) that I've written over the years. Itâ€™s interesting to look at from a historical perspective because you can see when I was [first learning OOP](https://clintwinter.me/blog/wibwo-1-library-and-design-patterns#learning) compared to where I am now.

I have a lot of proprietary work that I've built on the job that I'm proud of. I'd love to talk more about those projects.

#### Wins

Some projects that I've worked on that I believe to be noteworthy.

* **I re-wrote our data importer**, which originally used the laravel-excel package. It went from falling over when strained to handling thousands of imports and millions of records.
* **I re-wrote our data exporter**. What originally took hours and eventually stalled out when exporting 250k records now takes &lt;20 minutes. My version is also much more testable than laravel-excel.
  * It leverages Laravel's `AssertableJson` to test the CSV output.
  * It provides a really cool schema definition API similar to Laravel's migration schema for defining the CSV columns and their headers, formats, etc.

I've been entrusted with these critical input/output flows that allow potential customers to migrate into our platforms from other platforms.

#### A few more tidbits

* **I rise to the occassion.** I was the first full-time developer hired at my current startup, and I went from using Laravel for the first time professionally, to a senior developer and considered one of the most adept on the team.
* **I enjoy good design.** I'm sure you noticed, but I ripped off the Laravel documentation when making this page. I've often been complimented by designers on my ability to accurately bring their vision to life.
* **I care more than to just "get it done".** This is harder to get away with at a startup like mine (although I've always been able to respect this balance). To me, too much "science"-ifying destroys the magic of programming. It's similar to writing. I want it to flow well. To be simple, without excessive flourish. Intuitive. Unambiguous.

Thank you again for the opportunityâ€”I wish you the best of luck in selecting the most suitable candidates!
