#### Hey Adam ü§ù

I just want to preface with the fact that I do not believe myself to be an even remotely qualified candidate. However, I love Tailwind, I've enjoyed your content for a long time, and I want to try anyway. Seems like I'm not the only one who is intimidated by the role:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surprisingly getting fewer applicants for these roles than we did when we were hiring at less than half the salary back in 2020 before we had the budget we have now.<br><br>Would love any feedback on what we could improve here ü§î <a href="https://t.co/5FapZXiUw1">https://t.co/5FapZXiUw1</a></p>&mdash; Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1773341818773540949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I almost abandoned this application, but seeing your tweet made me realize I should submit this.

I'm happy to be applying to your *Staff Software Engineer* role! I believe that I have the right personality for this type of role because I've always enjoyed and appreciated design without being a designer.

Some fun facts about me that are Tailwind/Adam related...

* I convinced our front-end team to switch to Tailwind (from styled-components) and they've been singing its praises ever since.
* I own Refactoring UI and Tailwind UI. Refactoring UI was such a great book, I still reference it.
* Adam has some of my favorite Laracon talks. _Chasing "Perfect" (2015)_ is underrated and my favorite.

#### About Me

* I'm totally **self-taught** and have been **involved in PHP and subsequently Laravel for 8 years**. 
* I currently work for a startup called [Givebutter](https://givebutter.com) where I'm a senior full-stack developer.
    * Laravel back-end
    * React/TypeScript SPA front-end
* I've been in small companies/startups my whole career, so working for another small team would not be an adjustment for me.
* I'm no JavaScript wizard, but I've gotten quite comfortable working on our React SPA. It's challenging to keep up-to-date in the JavaScript world while also prioritizing Laravel.
* I'm not a tech lead, so I don't have experience directly managing people, but I have been put in charge of onboarding new devs and code-reviewing/guiding our less-experienced devs.
* Oh, and I'm on the east coast.

I don't have a ton of public work I can show you. But here's a couple things at least.
* The best I can offer is a [custom fields package for Laravel](https://github.com/givebutter/laravel-custom-fields/pull/36) that I did a lot of work on semi-recently. It was originally written by my CTO Liran and Daniel Coulborne. I'm linking a specific PR because it highlights my desire to do a thorough and professional job. That means going the extra mile curating things that I could have gotten away with ignoring, like my PR description or my comments explaining certain pieces of code.
* You can see my [blog posts](https://clintwinter.me/blog) that I've written over the years. It's interesting to look at from a historical perspective because you can see when I [was first learning OOP](https://clintwinter.me/blog/wibwo-1-library-and-design-patterns#learning) compared to where I am now.
* I'd also be willing to show you some things I've built internally that doesn't reveal our business. ü§´

#### Wins

* I **re-wrote our import processor**, which originally used the laravel-excel package. It went from falling over when strained to handling thousands of imports and millions of records.
* I recently **re-wrote our exporter**. What originally took hours and eventually stalled out when exporting 250k records now takes <20 minutes. My version is also much more testable than laravel-excel. It allows for assertable json tests against the csv result.
* I was the first full-time engineer hired at my company, and have been a huge influence on the style and direction of the codebase.
* I'm proud of myself for going from someone who committed to learning Laravel in my spare time to being one of the most proficient and capable developers in our company.

Overall, I've always (in my mind) been an underdog, and I've always ended up outperforming. Am I a hyper-talented, effortless superstar? No. But I will always attack my weaknesses and grow in ways I didn't know possible.

#### Who you are

I want to comment specifically on some points from your "Who you are" section of your job posting.

**You like to pair on problems.**

I've been advocating for pair programming for a while at my company. Honestly, it's a tough sell. Seems like that needs to be a culture thing from the top-down.

**You hold people to a high standard, and inspire them to do their best work.**

Here are a couple direct quotes from one of my self-evaluations at work:

> <p class="not-prose">I think I have a positive impact on our engineering culture with regard to maintaining a high bar for quality. I try to do that through multiple avenues:</p>
> <ul><li>In code reviews my goal is to strike a balance of helping them improve without being nitpicky. I want to keep them at the edge where growth happens without pushing them off.</li>
> <li>In my own code I make sure quality is a core part of what's being delivered. That means writing docs when it makes sense. Making sure the PR description is well-written and illustrative for the reviewer. It's important to lead by example. There's a broken-window effect with code where if the standards are inconsistent and messy, then nobody else bothers either.</li>
> <li>Lastly and maybe most important, I make sure to encourage others to do the same. On the front-end, in particular, I've told [redacted] not to hold back or to let me get away with anything. If he knows a better way to do something, let me in on the secret! I always want to be getting better. Everyone having their own ideas and seeing how they can help improve things is a great way to have continued progress.</li></ul>

and

> ...I have and will continue to encourage people to not hold back when it comes to expressing their opinion. Especially when it comes to code reviews and the like. I make sure they feel comfortable saying what needs to be said because if they think they need to censor themselves to preserve my feelings, then we aren't making progress.

**You‚Äôre fanatical about polish**

This is a tough one because working at a startup like mine means we have to ship. It's probably a good thing because I am prone to spending a lot of time on something small. Working at a place aligns with my personality in that way sounds like a dream.

**You love great design.**

I sometimes daydream about making a career pivot to design. My ability to create good designs is certainly nothing special, but I would say I'm much more capable than your average developer. Back-end developer especially!

Best of luck with your search, and I hope to hear from you!
